# Galaxy WealthTech Platform



Independent of the form, digital advice and technology are the
future of wealth management. Providing a digital experience has
become mandatory. Customer and financial advisors expect better
digital tools and the flexibility of human interaction to suit their
specific needs.


Embracing the FinTech ecosystem and using digital advice
platforms to provide a hybrid approach empowers wealth
management firms to evolve their business, attract a new
generation of customers and serve them in a flexible and costeffective way.
Moving to a hybrid approach also helps firms future-proof against
further changes to the wealth management model, providing
greater agility to meet the ever-changing regulatory and customer
environment.

Although the future is bright for wealth managers who successfully
complete this shift, pressure remains for continued innovation,
as non-financial service companies such as Uber, Alibaba and
Facebook recognize the opportunity at hand, start offering their
own form of financial services and begin a new battle.
